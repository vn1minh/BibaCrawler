## BibaCrawler
This project is to help people migrate/backup all of their conversations and attachments from Biba Messenger to their local machine

## Motivation
Since Amazon accquired Biba Messenger and replaced it with Amazon Chime, there's no provided method for data migration from Biba Messenger to Chime.
This was the main reason this project was put together. At least we can backup all Biba user data locally.

## How To Use
The tool requires Fiddler to capture Biba communication session Id, cookies, and user-agent. Once those data are entered into the tool,
it will be able to communicate with Biba Servers to retrieve all Chat Rooms and Contacts. Users could choose what Chat Rooms and Contacts to export.
